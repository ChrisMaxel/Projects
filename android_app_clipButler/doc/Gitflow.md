# Team Elephant Git Process
## Steps
1. If the feature in question could be disruptive to the functionality of the master branch, create an aptly-named branch for it.
2. Implement the feature in question and see that it is functional.
3. Commit and push the new changes to the branch.
4. Review the feature with the team and generate merge request.
5. Merge the branch to master
6. Delete the prior branch
>Steps 2-6 are identical for content / features that are not disruptive to the code.
