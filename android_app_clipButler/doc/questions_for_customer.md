#Questions for Dr. Stanley (aka. The customer)

1. Do you like the concept of having multiple pages that can be switched between on PREFS?
	- home_page --> with I/O switch
	- edit/view current coppied strings that are stored in the app
	- other settings page to adjust nubmer of clips, etc.

2. Is it okay that on a long press, a button appears that is not in the cut,copy,paste,etc. Menu?

3. Does the BUFFER have to be a scrollable list of items?  How should the user be able to exit the buffer(i.e. click off of the buffer)?
