	+ This document lays out the January computer science Ecuador trip I went on with my peers to build a software system for Arco Church.  The system helped the church track attendance and manage classes that they offered for their users.  I worked on the Development Opperations team to deploy our web application.  Recently, I have also worked on the testing (went from aproximatly 30% passing on over 100 tests to 100% passing with around 200 tests) using vue and a test suite.
