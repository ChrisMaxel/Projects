        Today we left for Ecuador, I woke up and met the team in the international terminal.  `Flight: Chicago --> Panama City --> Attempted Landing in Quito --> Guayaquil --> Quito`  I am excited to experience a new culture and hope to learn and take in a great deal from the Ecuadorians.  The flight to Panama City was excellent, I watched some Netflix and got to see the Florida Keys as we flew by.  The second flight to Quito was very bumpy on the initial landing attempt.  It was like riding the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disney World.  Our plane got directed to Guayaquil for a few hours as it was too bumpy to land.  While landed at Guayaquil I talked to the flight attendant in the back of the plane with Bryson, Josh James, and another girl that we met who was standing and talking in the back of the plane with us.  While in the back of the aircraft, Bryson, Josh and I practiced our Spanish on those in the back of the plane.  I calmed down a lot and began to have a good time.  I realized that my Spanish is not the best and I hope to improve my Spanish on this trip so that I can have better conversations with others in more languages.  Another one of my goals is to focus more on relationships.  I hope to get to know some of the leaders and students on the trip on a more personal level.  We finally landed late at night, and I ended up going to bed around 4AM.

        Today, we toured around Quito.  Breakfast at the hotel was excellent.  I had an omelet, and I tried so many new fruits including dragon fruit.  Then we went to `Pululahua Geobotanical Reserve.`  It was approximately 10,000 feet in the air.  We were practically even with the clouds.  It was so peaceful there, probably the closest to heaven I could imagine.  I was with my roommate Matt Hapner, and we realized that we could hear things so incredibly clear.  I think it is because the air is so thin there and there is less to interrupt sound waves.  This reserve is an active volcano that hasn't erupted for about 2,000 years and yet, people are still living at the bottom of it.  After this, we went to the middle of the world where I had the chance to stand on one half of the world while my friends stood on the other side.  They had incredible chocolate there that they made from cocoa beans.  It was so good!  Finally, we traveled to Cuenca, and the flight was much more smooth than the initial trip to Quito.

    4 Jan
    ----------
        Today, we traveled around the city of Cuenca.  First, we drove up to a high place in the town called Turi, while up there we could see down below that there was a large church in the middle of the city.  We drove there, and while there we saw a huge nativity scene, and climbed to the top of the church, it was approximately 150 stairs.  After that, we got lunch and went on a large double-decker tour bus, where a guide showed us around the city telling us interesting facts about the things around.  When the tour was over, we went to the clinic that was owned by the same people who own the church.  I was a bit nervous going here because there were so many sick people around and I was trying too hard to stay healthy for the trip.  We then went to a museum where we saw Inca ruins.  I did not find this museum interesting, and I think that there are better things we could've done with our time.  After we got back to the hotel and had the chance to unwind a bit, I organized a group to go to the market where I purchased some snacks and bread.  I had the opportunity to improve upon and practice my Spanish while checking out, and I seized this opportunity.  I learned how to say a few more words and I gained some confidence in this encounter.

    5 Jan
    ----------
        Today I walked to church and served Venezuelan refugees.  A group had gone before us and helped us make all of the food, and I was in a smaller group to help serve the food that was made.  This was an excellent experience to help and serve those around me.  I loved getting to interact with those around me.  I learned more Spanish, and I had some better conversations with the refugees.  I learned how to say food and drinks, and gained confidence in talking to others in Spanish.  This whole experience filled me up spiritually with joy, as I loved serving.  We went to Mochicka for lunch, they had fantastic food, the owner also attended the church, so we were helping to support a local business owner who went to Arco.  They had delicious tree tomato spicy sauce (I believe it is called ahi).  After lunch, we had a free day, so Matt, Sam, Nic and I went into the downtown of the city.  We found the broken bridge and ended up walking to this enormous park that was beautiful.  It was so green and had many fun things.  There was also a shocking number of couples making out, it was bizarre and not what I was used to.  Maybe that is a cultural thing where all the teens think "it's a nice day to go and make out in the park where there are children and families."  I do not fully understand it.  We stayed in the park for a while and relaxed and took in all of the beauty.  For dinner, the same group who went to the park plus Tim, Ben and Stan went out to a restaurant that translated to the grille horseshoe, it was good food.  Lots of meat.  I got the opportunity to get to know some other people on the trip better.

==================
    6 Jan
    ----------
        Today we got to sleep in a little bit and then went to church, before we left, I called my grandmother because it was her birthday and it was so lovely to talk to her, she donated for me to be on this trip.  She said that she was proud of me and happy that I am here and happy with what I am working on.  The church service was entirely in Spanish, so I did not understand very much of it.  I ended up journaling in my personal journal, and while thinking through some things, I was reminded that this trip is not about me (I was kind of struggling with being in Ecuador), and I realized that this trip was about doing something awesome for the church of Arco to help them better manage classes, statistics, and things like that.  I have sucked it up and dealt with the things that are bothering me or things I didn't like about the trip.  This humbled me for not only this trip but in my life.  My life is not about me, it's about doing what God has in store for me and doing those things in the best way I can to glorify God.  Realizing this, I gained a great deal of motivation to work hard on this project and do the best that I possibly can. After this, we went to Maria Paz house and had an excellent fish meal, and I learned how to make empanadas which were incredible.  We played some soccer there and met Josue, the "adopted" Taylor student that the Nurks took care of for a year.  The family was very welcoming because of this.  We stayed there for about 5 hours and then went back to the hotel.  When I got hungry again, I convinced a group of students to come out and get food with me at a restaurant called Parridogs (later known as Garage burgers).  They have incredible burgers there that are sold out of a window and then directly next to it is a garage where you receive your food and can sit.  Parridogs blew up, and so many people started going there for food.

    7 Jan (first day of work)
    ----------
        Today was my first day of work here.  The group walked to Arco church, and the leaders decided that it would be best for us to start with devotions in the morning.  Today's devotional was on how we are created in the image of God and therefore are "sub-creators."  We then Transitioned into an orientation where Dr. Nurk walked us through most of the code.  Then, we split into our teams, I am on the Development Operations team with Grace Rose and Nic Rose.  Everyone was working to set up their computers by going through and downloading the things in the develop.md file that Dr. Nurk had given to us.  I had issues with connecting to the wifi because my VPN was blocking the wifi.  Ben helped me disable many of the services that were blocking the wifi, and once we figured that out, it was lunchtime.  I appreciated Ben helping me set things up, and I hope to get to know him better on this trip.  After that, I started downloading all of the requirements.  While things were being downloaded, I took a walk around the building and found the arc bridge.  Once everything was downloaded, I set things up and got the corpus-christi web application running on the local host, this was awesome to see as I had just finished taking ISA last semester and I made wire-frames for each of the pages, and the web application looked similar to the wire-frames I had made.  It gave what I had done in a previous class a great deal of meaning. I learned that the servers are in Atlanta, GA which is where I am from (I thought about going to visit the servers... lol).  We got Ubuntu 18.04 running on the server as our operating system.  I worked with grace for most of the day pair programming (I drove most of the day).

    8 Jan
    ----------
        When I got to work, I began to download things for my computer, because I was still not done at the end of the day.  Wifi was out for most of the day as we lost power, and when the power came back on, it took a long time for the wifi to be up and running correctly.  Dr. Nurk did a lot of explaining to us about his vision for the server.  This really helped me learn a lot as I did not know much about servers coming into this trip.  From what Dr. Nurk taught us, we created a user to host the server and all of the downloads and installs.  We then started to set up Nginx and PostgreSQL and worked to set up an HTML file that nginx was pointing at.  We got it half working but only pointing at a fundamental step in Nginx's set up.  Dr. Nurk helped us get a domain name, and helped us decide on a good name.  We all agreed on corpus-christi.church to be the name for our web application.  After work, we had dinner at a really nice restaurant where I had one of my favorite meals, pork shoulder.  The restaurant had excellent views.  I took some beautiful pictures and played Matt's word game with the people at the table.  
        ![Figure [Jan 8 Image]: Matt and I in the restaurant with the awesome view.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisMaxel/Images/master/Ecuador%202019/Jan8.jpg)

    9 Jan
    ----------
        Today after our walk to church and our daily devotionals, Development Operations finished our work on Nginx.  Our demo website said, "Hi Mom and Dad!"  We sent to our parents, and they all loved it.  Once that was set up, we started to download more things onto the arco user. However, we did everything as sudo meaning it was owned by root, we went into a deep dark rabbit hole where everything became owned by root.  Once we realized what we had done, we restarted by deleting the current arco user and then re-creating a new arco user, with nothing on it.  We then got everything up and running correctly for arco user.  I went back to Parridogs for dinner with a few others from the group.  I have really enjoyed the openness of people in the group, I love that new people feel safe enough to go out with a few of us that we are not entirely familiar with.

    10 Jan
    ----------
        Today, we had the devotional downstairs by the coffee shop.  There was a Lutheran pastor who was such a good speaker, he was slightly monotone, but he delivered such incredibly moving and powerful messages.  Today, he talked about Jesus' baptism. Why did he need it when he was sinless? And then what does that mean about our salvation, do we have to repent daily? Our salvation is not dependent on our actions, we will fail. We were dead in our transgressions. Dead people can't say "Yes, I will follow you." We are given it, but grow our faith through the holy spirit. I still have a lot of questions about it, but I didn't think now was the time.  Grace started work on the SSH keys while Nic and I finished up setting up Nginx to point at our actual web application HTML page.  Grace quickly finished that and helped to set them up for us which helped keep things more secure.  We quickly found out that the corpus-christi.  The church web page did not have full functionality and was actually missing some buttons.  After bringing this to Dr. Nurk, we learned that we needed to reset the database to initialize it again.  Once we did this, we got back some missing buttons, but we're still missing key functionality.  We went bowling at the mall with our group, that was really fun, and I got to know some of the group better, which was awesome to do.

    11 Jan
    ----------
        Today after the walk to church and the devotionals Dev Ops picked up where we left off working on PostgreSQL the database tool.  It was difficult today because we had a lot of errors with the database.  We decided to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL to make our server run better; however we had issues with other members of the team not entering the correct length into fields of the database.  We continued on with the day, and I was working with Nginx.  I created a mock website to load on the corpus-christi.church website.  After I got that up and running and in the nginx/sites-enabled folder, I changed the mock webpage to say "Hi Mom and Dad!!!" This was fun to send to our parents, and it gave me the motivation to hear their replies to it.  Grace and Nic worked on removing the /public from the end of the website name.  They did an excellent Job and removed that.  After work, I went to the top of Turi with a group of guys, and we went on the swing over the city, and the infamous crazy ball.  They were both so fun, and I did a lot of screaming.

    12 Jan
    ----------
        Today, we drove about an hour to a beautiful waterfall.  We got the chance to go under the waterfall and stand inside of the stream of water that was coming down.  Then, we got to go swimming where the water collected.  The water was cold, and when I jumped into the pool of water, it felt as if I had gone into shock.  I took some incredible pictures here.  From there, we traveled to `Hosteria Lago de Cristal` or the Christal Lake.  It was like being at a summer camp, there were zip-lines over pools, swings and tree houses.  There were also games inside like chess, ping-pong, and pool, I played chess, and while sitting with Stan, I learned that he was ranked in chess, and is pretty good at it.  After we got tired out here, we drove back to Casa Lloret and went to bed as we were all exhausted.

Weak Three Journal
====================
    13 Jan
    ----------
        We drove to a man who was hand making scarfs, he showed us how he colored the materials he was making scarfs with.  He used bugs that are found in cactus to make a specific color and then could add salt to lighten the color.  It was an impressive process to see in action.  He then took us up to his shop, I thought his items were a bit expensive.  I decided that even though they were costly, I should get some for my family members, I got two scarfs.  I think that I may have regretted not getting scarfs.  We then went to an orchid shop, where there were hundreds of orchids, and there were so many different types.  There was one specific one that when it bloomed, it looked like a fly was sitting in the middle of it.  I am guessing that this helped with pollination of the plant.  We then went to a buffet where I tried seviche (a cold soup that had a lot of cilantro in it) and ate a lot of shrimp, it was good food.  Then we had free time around there where I played tennis, soccer, and basketball.

    14 Jan
    ----------
        The group started off this morning with Darci's devotional that taught about how it's okay not always to be doing something (continually productive), and we should be intentional with being present with those around us (including Christ who is in us).  My first task of the day was to set up HTTPS for [corpus-christi.church](http://corpus-christi.church) and [www.corpus-christi.church](http://www.corpus-christi.church) This is really cool because it was somewhat simple to do and any user who tries to navigate to HTTP://corpus-christi.church will automatically be navigated to HTTPS://corpus-christi.church.  I did this with Grace.  I built a stronger relationship with her as we worked together, and I learned how to better work in a team.  Nic worked on continuous integration. To allow for when a developer pushes their changes to GitHub, the server will automatically detect that, pull the changes from GitHub and have a live version of the website up and running.

    15 Jan
    ----------
        This morning on our walk to the church, Darci asked us to get into pairs or small groups of people that we have not talked to yet, and discuss one thing that we have loved and one thing that is bothering us (even if it was Darci herself).  I got together with Jason Argo, and it was so lovely to rant and hear that someone else is bothered by the same things as I am.  (I'm not going to mention what the issue was in this journal because I will be graded on it)  It was also awesome to hear Jason's favorite part of the trip.  When we got to church we had a devotional I learned how to better hear God, through sharing his story of how he had a car that God did not initially intend for him to have and once he gave that car up, God provided for him. Dev Ops has been researching continuous integration, which is our end goal.  Grace, Nic, and I created the .travis.yml file, which has an awesome file type name (yaml).  The Dev Ops team ran into errors when trying to run the command "yarn install" which was confusing because it used to work before; hopefully, we will be able to fix that tomorrow.
        ![Figure [Jan 15 Image]: This is some yummy Cui or roasted guinea pig.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisMaxel/Images/master/Ecuador%202019/Jan15.jpg)

    16 Jan
    ----------
        Today, the devotional was with the head pastor of the church.  He discussed how God works in people and how he got a calling to come to Ecuador even though he didn't know the language or the culture.  He also talked about how Christians in high up places will often leave worldly jobs to serve in some other way, and while this is good, it is terrible in that, Christians are losing their positions in these high up roles, making Christians look weaker and taking Christians out of jobs and away from some unbelievers, where we(as Christians) may lose the opportunity to save someone.  I hope to have God point me in the right direction soon.  I am unsure of what I would like to do with the rest of my life, I think I have figured out that Development Operations may not be my calling in life.  Nic and Grace figured out how to run the .travis.yml file so with very bare bones commands, and it has successfully run when things are being pushed.  I started my day off by talking to Noah Lindsey about how to run all of the tests end to end.  He sent me the two commands that let us do that. Our team needed this command because we want to have it in the .travis.yml file eventually.  For lunch today, we had rice and chicken, and it was tasty, and usually, with every meal, there are fun fruit drinks or tea, having these fun new drinks every day has been such a new and exciting experience.  I feel like I have not seen the same drink twice even though we have a new drink for breakfast and lunch.  After lunch, we have been working to configure the .travis.yml file, that has been a lot of work, but we have been making good progress, and have got it running and tracking the git pushes to the repository.  After work, we went to thermal baths.  This was really nice to do, as it was really relaxing and was needed.  We did two kinds of mud baths and went in various pools, some of the pools were warm, some hot, and few were cold.  I enjoyed the warm and hot pools the most.
        ![Figure [Jan 16 Image]: The thermal baths were we rubbed mud all over our selves.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisMaxel/Images/master/Ecuador%202019/Jan16.jpg)

    17 Jan
    ----------
        Jason Argo gave a devotional today, and he told us some of his testimony and asked us to write down one or two big positive things that happened last year, and one or two things that you would like to happen this year.  Both things I wrote down were about my girlfriend.  I have a lot of big things that happened, and I would love to figure out.  I am kinda freaked out because I am not in love with the idea of being a developer for the rest of my life.  I really liked SYS390 or Informations System Analysis or ISA, and I think that I could see myself in that field.  I have found that through this trip, I may not want to do Dev Ops again, I'm happy that I have found one thing that I do not want to do.  The stand-ups here I have enjoyed.  I like being on a smaller team and not having to do the stand-up in the afternoon because we are all on the same page and usually working together on things.  Diana brought in empanadas yesterday, and they were so incredibly good.  They had chicken and cheese in them.

    18 Jan
    ----------
        Diana shared her story with us today.  It was very empowering and reminded me that even if your life is not going perfect, God still has a plan for you and a way to use you.  Her life sounded complicated at times, and it was so incredible and powerful to hear that she kept her faith in the Lord and realized that He was preparing her for greater things.  My view of the Ecuadorian culture has changed in that I realized that many of them want to go to America to make money and live the "American Dream."  It made me feel very blessed for living in such a fantastic country that so many people strive to get to (I am doing my best to word this appropriately and humbly).  Diana showed us the Venezuelan refugees that we were helping just by being here.  It is fantastic that Diana is assisting others to get plugged into Arco church.  We are assisting these refugees by Diana bringing in their goods and foods for us to eat (we end up paying them).

    19 Jan
    ----------
        Today, we drove for about two hours to a big Catholic church.  There were lots of catacombs there, and it kinda freaked me out, for some reason on this trip, I have had an anxiety of dying.  I don't know why I have had this fear on this trip, but I have not enjoyed it.  There were many beatles around this church, they were big and had a yellowish shell.  We eventually got back on the bus and drove for about 30 more minutes to Inca Ruins.  While here, we visited a museum.  After a few minutes of the museum, Matt and I left to be outside and walk around a bit.  There was an Alpaca, and we were petting it and took some awesome pictures with it.  After that, there were some shops nearby.  Matt and I bargained for two blankets and one fluffy alpaca figure, my Spanish got better as Matt, and I negotiated for these blankets and souvenirs.  The ruins looked similar to the other Inca ruins that we saw earlier on the trip.  While walking around, I learned some interesting things, such as the Inca's had a room set up where sunlight would shine in at a golden Idol and based on which one was illuminating, they would know if they were supposed to plant, harvest, or store up food.  This was all based on the position of the sun.  I am blown away by how smart the Inca's were.  They figured out the sun was in different positions at different times of the year, they were making discoveries as Einstein would have.  Their minds must have worked in such incredible ways.

Week Four Journal
===================

    ----------
        We skipped church today, and went to the `Cajas National Park.`  This was approximately 10,500 to 11,000 feet above sea level.  It was beautiful here, and I learned why it is called Cajas which translates to boxes in English.  There were many lakes there at the park and mountains around the lakes, forming a sort of box.  I find it interesting here that so many places are named after things they are around.  It is awesome that the name of a place can give away some important information about the area.  For example, Upland, IN is one of the highest places in Indiana.  While at the park, I took some awesome pictures and found a little caterpillar friend that we took pictures with.  While there, I wish that we could've gone up higher, it was like I got an adrenaline rush every time I went up higher.  I have some sort of strange craving to get as high up as I can.  For lunch, I ordered this fish that was incredibly tasty, the bones were still in so I had to be careful with what I was eating.  That night, I walked around downtown Cuenca with a group of guys.  Almost all of the shops were closed, so we ended up walking back to Casa Lloret, and I had a relaxing night playing Pinochle and going to bed early.

    21 Jan
    ----------
        Today on my walk to church, I became light-headed and dizzy, when I got to church, I sat down and drank a lot of water.  When I somewhat recovered, we learned that the elders and people of the church will be coming in on Wednesday for all of our teams to present for about 30 minutes to them.  Ben started off our morning after Nurk's morning announcements, and he gave us a message on a lot of good general principles.  Things like staying humble and trusting in God.  His main point was how to deal with conflict properly, and that sometimes it is even best to forget that it happened.  Over this trip, the more I have got to know Ben, the more impressed with how well he knows the word of God, we have had multiple discussions on religious aspects, and I have loved to have the opportunity to connect with him in that sense.  Today at work, I helped Grace with the `Flask DB upgrade` command as Nic continued work on the .travis.yml file.

    22 Jan
    ----------
        Today, on the way to the church, we were asked to reflect on Martin Luther King Jr as yesterday was a day that in America we devote to him.  I was surprised that we did nothing to remember him yesterday, and that we were at work.  Usually, that is a day that we are given off by companies, businesses, and schools.  I talked with others on the group about MLK and how he not only affected America but how he inspired people of other countries.  Today's devotional was delivered to us by the Guido brothers father, John.  He brought up one specific verse in Matthew where Jesus looks at the crowds, and John put us in the shoes of Jesus for a moment and explained what Jesus was looking at the crowds really was.  He said that the crowds were sinners, and those who may be doing drugs and wrong things, and when we see them, we will most likely judge them, but when Jesus saw them, he did so with compassion.   Last night for dinner, a medium-sized group of about ten went to this incredible restaurant named Tiestos.  It was highly recommended by our first tour guide in Quito, Esteban, and other Ecuadorian locals that we talked to.

    23 Jan (last work day)
    ----------
        Today before our walk to church, Darci reminded us that today was our last day of work, and the last day that we would be going on this walk to church.  She asked us to reflect and tell another person on our walk what we appreciated about the walk.  I told Matt about how I love the park we are walking through it because it is so green and beautiful.  I also like the river next to me making beautiful sounds.  When we got to church, Isma gave the devotional today.  He taught us about Luke 26-39 about Jesus' encounter with a scary man (hung out in the graveyard and was demon possessed).  Jesus changed this man by merely talking to him.  I loved the message as it touched my heart and made me want to go speak to those people who are cast out by society.  The Dev Ops team is working to wrap things up as best as we can to give Arco the most complete project as possible.

        Today, we got to sleep in and we drove to Guayaquil.  While on the drive to here, we stopped at a place in `Cajas National Park` that was 13,000 feet above sea level.  It was so beautiful, Matt and I took some awesome pictures and then decided to try to run.  That was an interesting choice that we made.

        `Guayaquil --> Panama City --> Chicago --> Taylor` Today was a very long day.  We left the hotel at Midnight and traveled for the entirety of the day.  It was a bit hectic, and as I am journaling this, I am so happy that I am done traveling for a while.  The
